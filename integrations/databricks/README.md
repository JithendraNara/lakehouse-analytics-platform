# Databricks + Spark Parity Artifacts

This folder captures Spark parity for the lakehouse pipeline.

## Files
- `lakehouse_parity_job.py`: Spark SQL/DataFrame-based staging + mart creation.
- `notebook_outline.md`: Databricks notebook workflow structure.

These artifacts are intentionally lightweight but executable with Spark runtime.
